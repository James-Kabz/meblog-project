      "body": "The story revolves around the aftermath of a failed coup attempt against a corrupt government. The main character, Doga, is a university lecturer who becomes disillusioned with the state of affairs in his country. He is arrested and tortured for his involvement in the coup, along with other political dissidents.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, the play delves into the struggles of ordinary citizens who are caught in the crossfire of political turmoil. It highlights the pervasive corruption and oppression faced by the people, as well as the betrayal they experience at the hands of those in power.\n\n\"Betrayal in the City\" is a powerful critique of authoritarianism and political oppression, drawing attention to the human rights abuses and injustices faced by many in post-colonial African societies. Through its vivid characters and thought-provoking dialogue, the play challenges audiences to confront the harsh realities of life under oppressive regimes and to question the moral integrity of those in authority."
